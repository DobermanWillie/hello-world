HELLO, Hello, hello...
I am new to the site and just learning.  I have done a little Unix Sys Admin and some Oracle many years ago.  I try to learn so I can have intelligent conversations with developers about code.  I like to talk with people that view dev as a craft.  They interest me the most because of their passion.  Lots od coders out there now for the paycheck.  I like chatting with the folks doing it for the love of the game.
